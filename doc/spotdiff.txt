INTRODUCTION                                           *spotdiff*

This plugin has been developed in order to make diff mode more useful.
Vim always shows a diff for whole lines of a window. But this plugin allows
to specify the range and then partially make a spot diff.

This plugin provides another `:diffthis` and `:diffoff` commands, which are
`:Diffthis` and `:Diffoff`.

You can use `:Diffthis` to select a block of lines and to make the current
window diff mode. Other lines than selected will be highlighted with Conceal
so that 'conceallevel' and 'concealcursor' options can be used to hide them.
When two separate windows become diff mode, `:Diffthis` shows their spot diffs
in those windows without opening a new window and tab page.

Use `:Diffoff` to clear the selected block of lines and to reset diff mode
for the current window. If `!` is specified, clear and reset for all windows
in the current tab page.

This plugin also makes it possible to select two blocks of lines in a single
window, to see the differences between them within one file. `:Diffthis`
tries to open a temporary new window above or below of the current one,
copies secondly selected lines to it, and makes spot diffs with source window.
This temporary window will be closed when `:Diffoff` is used on it.

This plugin tries to repair any diff mode mismatch, but please do not use the
original `:diffthis` and `:diffoff` together with `:Diffthis` and `:Diffoff`
to prevent any errors and troubles. Try `:Diffoff!` to reset all in the case.

It is recommended to install |diffchar.vim| plugin
(https://github.com/rickhowe/diffchar.vim) so that you can see the exact
differences.

CHANGE HISTORY                                         *spotdiff-history*

Update : 1.1
* `:Diffthis` highlights other lines than selected with Conceal, instead of
  showing selected lines with sign feature.
* `:Diffthis` and `:Diffoff` try to repair any diff mode mismatch, instead of
  stopping with error messages.
* The 'diffopt' foldcolumn:{n} option was ignored, but follows it as vim does.
* A temporary new window, which opens when `:Diffthis` is used twice in a
  single window, was sometimes too large, but shows as few as those lines.
