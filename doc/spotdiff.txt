INTRODUCTION                                           *spotdiff*

This plugin has been developed in order to make diff mode more useful.
Vim always makes a diff for all lines in a window. But this plugin allows
to specify the range and then partially make a spot diff.

This plugin provides another `:diffthis` and `:diffoff` commands, which are
`:Diffthis` and `:Diffoff`.

You can use `:Diffthis` to select a block of lines and to make the current
window diff mode. Selected lines are visually color-marked at line head.
When two separate windows become diff mode, `:Diffthis` shows their spot diffs
in those windows without opening a new window and tab page.

Use `:Diffoff` to clear the selected block of lines and to reset diff mode
for the current window. If `!` is specified, clear and reset for all windows
in the current tab page.

This plugin also makes it possible to select two blocks of lines in a single
window, to see the differences between them within one file. `:Diffthis` tries
to open a temporary new window above or below of the current one, copies
secondly selected lines to it, and makes spot diffs with source window.
This temporary window will be closed when `:Diffoff` is used on it.

Please do not use the original `:diffthis` and `:diffoff` together with
`:Diffthis` and `:Diffoff` to prevent any errors and troubles. Try `:Diffoff!`
to reset all in the case.

It is recommended to install |diffchar.vim| plugin
(https://github.com/rickhowe/diffchar.vim) so that you can see the exact
differences.
