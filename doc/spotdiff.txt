INTRODUCTION                                           *spotdiff*

Vim provides diff mode which is useful to see differences between windows.
However, it always shows the differences for entire line. And can not compare
a sequence of words within a line, and sentences and paragraphs which are
separated into several lines.

To compare partially everywhere in windows, this plugin provides two groups of
commands, which are alternative to vim original `:diffthis`, `:diffoff`, and
`:diffupdate`. One is for which allows to select a range of lines to be
compared in diff mode. Another is for which allows to select the Visual area
to be compared in non-diff normal mode. Both work independently in a tab page.

Do not use vim original diff commands together with this plugin's ones to
prevent any errors and troubles.

It is recommended to install |diffchar.vim| plugin
(https://github.com/rickhowe/diffchar.vim) so that you can see the exact
differences.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Selecting A Range Of Lines                             *spotdiff-range*

There are `:Diffthis`, `:Diffoff`, and `:Diffupdate` commands available.

:[range]Diffthis
	Select a range of lines with [range] and make the current window diff
	mode. If [range] is not specified, the current line will be selected.
	The selected lines are highlighted in |hl-CursorColumn|. When two
	separate windows become diff mode, `:Diffthis` shows the differences
	for selected lines in each window. It is possible to select two ranges
	of lines in the same window. `:Diffthis` opens a temporary new window
	above or below of the current one, copies selected lines to it, and
	shows the difference with source window.

:Diffoff[!]
	Clear the selected range of lines and reset diff mode for the current
	window. If `!` flag is specified, clear and reset for all windows in the
	current tab page. The temporary window created by `:Diffthis` will be
	closed when its original window is cleared.

:Diffupdate[!]
	Update the differences for the selected range of lines. If `!` flag is
	specified, the file is reloaded if necessary.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Selecting the Visual area                              *spotdiff-area*

There are `:VDiffthis`, `:VDiffoff`, and `:VDiffupdate` commands available.
Note that they work in non-diff normal mode.

:[range]VDiffthis[!]
	Select the last characterwise, linewise, or blockwise Visual area in
	the current window. If [range] is different from the last Visual area,
	it is selected as linewise Visual area. The selected area is
	highlighted in |hl-DiffChange| with "italic", and then will be
	compared as a single combined line. But if `!` flag is specified, each
	line is separately compared, which would be useful particular for
	columns in a table on blockwise area. Redundant lines in the
	line-by-line comparison are shown with "strikethrough". Shortly after
	the two area are selected, `:VDiffthis` compares them based on the
	|g:DiffUnit| option and "icase", "iwhite", "iwhiteall" and "iwhiteeol"
	flags in the 'diffopt' option. Then their differences are shown using
	the |g:DiffColors| option. It is possible to select two Visual area in
	the same window.

	|g:DiffUnit|, |t:DiffUnit|
	    A type of difference unit
		'Char'   : any single character
		'Word1'  : \w\+ word and any \W single character (default)
		'Word2'  : non-space and space words
		'Word3'  : \< or \> character class boundaries

	|g:DiffColors|, |t:DiffColors|
	    Matching colors for changed units (|hl-DiffAdd| for added units)
		0   : |hl-DiffText| (default)
		1   : |hl-DiffText| + up to 3 other highlights
		2   : |hl-DiffText| + up to 7 other highlights
		3   : |hl-DiffText| + up to 15 other highlights

:VDiffoff[!]
	Clear the selected area in the current window and reset its
	differences. If `!` flag is specified, clear and reset all area in the
	current tab page.

:VDiffupdate
	Compare the selected area again and show their differences in the
	current tab page, when you make changes to the selected area or you
	want to change |g:DiffUnit| or |g:DiffColors| option.

CHANGE HISTORY                                         *spotdiff-history*

Update : 4.0
* Added `:VDiffthis`, `:VDiffoff`, and `:VDiffupdate` commands to select the
  Visual area to be compared as a single combined line or multiple separate
  lines.
* Removed to use Conceal and Sign features in `:Diffthis` command.

Update : 3.2
* Changed to use |hl-CursorLine|, instead of underline and '-' in the fold
  column, to indicate the selected lines.

Update : 3.1
* Set a plugin specific expression to 'diffexpr' option while spot diff'ed to
  disable a new internal diff (patch-8.1.360).

Update : 3.0
* Disable a new internal diff in 'diffopt' option (patch-8.1.360) to prevent
  unselected lines to be incorrectly diff'ed. And make this plugin work well
  even if an external diff command is not available.
* Open a temporary window, when `:Diffthis` is used twice in a single window,
  highly enough to display all selected lines. And close it when `:Diffoff` is
  used not only in it but also in the original window.
* Support new iwhiteall and iwhiteeol of 'diffopt' option.
* Removed a support for vim version 7.x.

Update : 2.2
* Added `:Diffupdate` command.

Update : 2.1
* The selected lines are all underlined using sign feature, in addition to a
  '-' in the fold column, to make them more visible.
* Fixed some defects.

Update : 2.0
* `:Diffthis` indicates the selected lines with a '-' in the fold column.
* `:Diffthis` always highlighted other lines than selected with |hl-Conceal|,
  but `!` is required as optionally.

Update : 1.1
* `:Diffthis` highlights other lines than selected with |hl-Conceal|, instead
  of showing selected lines with sign feature.
* `:Diffthis` and `:Diffoff` try to repair any diff mode mismatch, instead of
  stopping with error messages.
* The 'diffopt' foldcolumn:{n} option was ignored, but follows it as vim does.
* A temporary new window, which opens when `:Diffthis` is used twice in a
  single window, was sometimes too large, but shows as few as those lines.
